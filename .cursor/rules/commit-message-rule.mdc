# Generate Commit Message
- At the end of every response, provide a brief, copyable commit message that summarizes the changes made during the conversation.
- Format the commit message with a clear title line followed by a blank line and descriptive bullet points.
- Structure the commit message in a code block for easy copying.
- Include the scope of changes, what was modified, and why the changes are valuable.
- Only include a commit message when actual code changes have been made.
