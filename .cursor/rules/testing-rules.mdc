# Test Behavior, Not Implementation
- **Focus on user outcomes and observable behavior** rather than internal implementation details.
- **Create realistic usage scenarios** that mimic how components are actually used in the application.
- **Each test should validate a specific user-visible expectation** or interaction pattern.
- **Tests should remain valid even if internal implementation changes** - they should test what the code does, not how it does it.

# Ignored
# **Prefer integration-style tests** that demonstrate components working together when appropriate.
